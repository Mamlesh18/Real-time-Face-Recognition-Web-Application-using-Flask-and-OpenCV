# Real-time-Face-Recognition-Web-Application-using-Flask-and-OpenCV

Commands to Run the Flask Application:
Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>

Instructions for Users:
In your README file, include instructions for users to upload their images to the image directory (images/ in your case). You can add a section like this:

Uploading Images:

To use the face recognition feature, upload your images to the images/ directory in the repository. Ensure each image contains a clear, frontal view of a face you want to recognize. The application will automatically load these images during startup for recognition purposes.

This setup assumes your Flask application (app.py or another named file) handles the logic to load and process images from the images/ directory as shown in your provided Python code. Adjust the paths and instructions according to your specific project structure and requirements.
